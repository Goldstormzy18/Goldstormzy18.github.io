    <p>Below these buttons are SUPER movements (They move you 3 times at once and are for convenience)</p>
    <p></p>
    <button>up</button>

    <p>Scattered throughout the levels are "M" (monsters) Upon getting within one tile of these, combat mode will start</p>
    <p>Also scattered through the levels are "H" (health packs) These increase your life by one</p>
    <p>Finally, in each level are "E" (exits) These advance you to further levels</p>
    <p>Your goal is to get to the highest possible level</p>
    <h1>Combat Guide</h1>
    <p>Upon entering combat, you will be greeted with "0123456789"</p>
    <p>A cursor will scroll through these numbers</p>
    <p>Press down on "ATTACK!!" whenever you want and try to release it on the highest possible number</p>
    <p>If you hit, the enemy will lose the corresponding amount of health</p>
    <p>If you miss, you lose a life</p>
    <p>The game ends if you die 3 times, so keep an eye on that life counter and try not to get into any uneccesary battles</p>
