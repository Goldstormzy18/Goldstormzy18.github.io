        <h1>How To Animate A Scene</h1>
        <h1>(Illustrations to come during final draft)</h1>
        <p>This guide is for digital animation and assumes the possession of a drawing tablet.<br>
            The examples are made in Adobe Animate but this guide is applicable to any animation software.<br>
            Basic knowledge of your animation software of choice is assumed for this guide.</p>

        <h1>Part 1: Storyboards</h1>
        <h2>Plan out the animation</h2>
        <p>To start, you will make a storyboard. Every second or so, create a "keyframe".<br>
            This is a frame that happens between major movements during the animation.<br>
            Draw any characters and moving objects during the scene for the keyframes.<br>
            Also sketch out the background during this step, so you know where in the frame to draw your characters.</p>
        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <p>Make sure to have a script and voice lines ready before you start the animation process.<br>
            You don't want to redo animation just because the script needed a change.
        <br>---<br>
            You will eventually want to get a reference sheet for your characters.<br>
            This is a sheet that has the character drawn with correct proportions on it to ensure consistency.<br>
            It isn't incredibly important for a beginner; just try to keep your characters consistently sized!.
        <br>---<br>
            Keep the keyframes quick and sketchy during this step. You will draw over them in a later step.</p>

        <h1>Part 2: Line Art</h1>
        <h2>Create rough animation</h2>
        <p>During this step, you will draw between the keyframes that you made in the last step.<br>
            You will be "Connecting the dots" in a way, making the movement that happens between the keyframes.<br>
            Keep these inbetween frames quick and sketchy. You will go over them again in the next step.<br>
            Also sketch out the background during this step, so you know where in the frame to draw your characters.</p>
        
        <h2>Draw cleanly over the rough animation</h2>
        <p>This is the longest and most time consuming step. Here, you will be tracing over your rough sketches.<br>
            Make sure that you are drawing cleanly and on a different layer than your sketches.<br>
            Start with the keyframes that you made in step one, then do the others in your preferred order..<br>
            This step can get a little repetitive and mindless, but it can also be relaxing!.<br></p>
        
        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <p>The standard for animation in most studios is 24 frames per second. For a beginner, I'd reccomend 12.<br>
            The more frames per second, the smoother the animation is, but this comes at the cost of more effort.<br>
            Double the FPS means double the smoothness, but you'll be drawing twice the frames. Diminishing returns apply!
        <br>---<br>
            If a character has long hair or jewlery, don't draw them while sketching the rough body movements.<br>
            Go over all the frames a second time when you finish the rough animation to keep their movements seperate.
        <br>---<br>
            Make heavy use of the "onion skin" feature of your animation software while sketching.
        <br>---<br>
            All body movement happens in "arcs". If you are just drawing frames linearly between keyframes, it will look ugly.<br>
            If an arm moves, keep in mind that it has a bone and is on a joint. Same with the legs and head.</p>

        <h1>Part 3: Coloring</h1>
        <h2>Color with solid colors</h2>
        <p>This is the most satisfying step. Color in your characters and objects with solid colors.<br>
            Don't worry about shading, that will be done after the initial colors.<br>
            The background can be colored at any time, but I reccomend doing it at the start of<br>
            this step to allow you to plan the object and character colors around the background.</p>
            
        <h2>Shade the scene</h2>
        <p>For the final step, start shading each onject in the scene.<br>
            For every color in every frame, imagine where in the scene the light is coming from.<br>
            Shade the side of every object in every frame where a light is not facing.<br>
            For instance, if it is high noon, shade the bottom of the objects. For dark places with a<br>
            single light source, shade the sides that are facing away from the light.</p>
        
        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
            There is no shame in using the paint bucket tool to instantly fill in an area.<br>
            For open line art where you can't use the paint bucket tool, use the "Draw Inside" tool<br>
            to "plaster over" the hole in the line art and then use the paint bucket tool.
        <br>---<br>
        <p>Most animation software has a feature that allows you to draw only in the first color that you<br>
            start drawing in. This is usually called "Draw Inside" and it is very good for shading.
        <br>---<br>
            While shading with the color yellow, never just shade with darker yellow.<br>
            Always either go darker with a little bit of red or blue added to avoid dark yellow, which is ugly.</p>
