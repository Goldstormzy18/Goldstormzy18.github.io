    <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
    <p class="text">
        Corn’d Beef is a company set on curing people of veganism. We are planning to do so by introducing the Corn’d Beef patty. The patty, made of ½ beef, ½ veggies, will suit as a transition patty to turn vegans back to normal. Psychologically, each patty a vegan eats will be justified by the reduced beef content, making them think that less cows were slaughtered when in reality, the same amount of beef is being used, just distributed thinly to make more patties. The Corn’d Beef company plans to open up a restaurant to sell specialty burgers to transitioning vegans to help them embrace the omnivorous, meat filled lifestyle. We also plan to sell pre-packaged patties in Whole Foods across the United States of America.  
    </p>
    <h1>OUR COMPETION</h1>
    <p class="text">
        We will be competing with various predatory companies who prey on helpless people by selling meat substitute products made from solely vegetables. Examples of these companies include Strong Roots, Hungry Planet, and NotBurger. Corn’d Beef openly refuses to put estrogen inside their patties.
    </p>
    <h1>OUR OUTREACH</h1>
    <p class="text">    
        You will be hard pressed to find any television channel with more of our target audience watching it other than TLC. This is why we will put our advertisements on the channel, because many suffering vegans view the channel. We will advertise our restaurant first, showing the freshly cooked burger and how amazing it looks. We will follow up with the frozen patties, showing how they’re available at your local Whole Foods. Through our restaurant, a Corn’d Burger will be an inexpensive purchase of $4.59 per burger. With ingredients and labor costs adding up to $3.80, we would make a profit of $0.79 per burger. The frozen patties will come in at $29.99 for 10 ⅓ patties.
